# BIMA – Building Information Modeling Application (Concept for Future Implementation)
- Laser Scanning As-Built Services
    -Scan-to-IFC (Ideal Solution...)
      - Powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning for automated segmentation — evolving from semi-automatic to fully automatic workflows. This approach remains largely unexplored in the current market, offering a significant innovation opportunity.

- Scan-to-Revit (Current Industry Standard)
    - Widely adopted but still performed manually. This method is less suited for long-term building lifecycle management due to its static and labor-intensive nature.

- Custom CDE (Common Data Environment) Development
    - Personally developed to integrate data from building installations, whether residential or commercial, enabling centralized and structured information management.
